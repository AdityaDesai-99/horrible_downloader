- ***uTorrent or qBitTorrent***<br/>
    Using horrible downloader, you will be able to not only open magnet links but also automatically start their downloads in your default software! At this moment horrible downloader supports uTorrent and qBitTorrent, so ensure one of these two is associated with torrents in your system.

- Download all the required software files from here. Unzip them in any directory on your computer.<br/><br/>
- Double click the `setup.py` file to start the installation process.<br/><br/>
- Wait for the installer to install the required Python modules in your computer. This could take a while.<br/><br/>
- When the installer shows you a prompt to tell it which browser out of given two options would you like to use, type the name of your preferred browser and press enter.<br/><br/>
- Wait for the installer to download the required web driver and unzip it. This could take a while.<br/><br/>

  - Search for default apps in your search menu
  - Click on `Choose default apps by file type`
  - Search which file is associated with .torrent<br/><br/>
- Next, the installer should ask you where you want to store your downloaded anime. Copy & paste the path to the folder where you want it to save the downloaded episodes.<br/><br/>
- Next, the installer should ask you what quality you want the downloaded episodes to be in. Do not foget to write the `p` when typing your answer!<br/><br/>
  
We have finished installing the software with your preferences! Now all we need to do is make a list of the currently ongoing anime that horrible downloader will check for new episodes each time you run it. Wait for the menu to come up, and from then on it's an easy and intuitive process where you can add anime to your list, remove anime from your list, change the episode to be downloaded next time of an anime already in your list or clear your currently watching.
